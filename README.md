# Chinese Writing Assessment with LLMs

This repo includes codes utilizing LLMs (GPT, iFLYTEK and Baidu Cloud) to assess students writing assignment. For privacy concerns, all students data are not included as well as keys for LLMs API calling. If you have questions of setting up an account to those platforms, feel free to send me an email.

- `Full_Version` includes all codes includes data processing, result analysis and confusion matrix calculation. Those codes are not well organized and may not be easy to read. They were used only for the current study's data. If you need help on how to use them, I would love to help.
